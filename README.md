# JobBars
A plugin for XIVQuickLauncher which provides extra job gauges and a party buff tracker

Including:
- Number of GCDs under buffs (such as Fight or Flight, Inner Release)
- DoT tracker (such as Dia, Miasma)
- Proc display (Verfire/Verstone Ready)

## Usage
To open the settings menu, use `/jobbars`

## TODO
- custom arrow texture
- more animated movement
- random crash when loading sometimes
- test loading from devplugins
- party members
- right justify
- AST: when star is ready
- BLM: fire or thunder proc
- MCH: number of charges?
- change order
- still some flickering with icons (for example, BLM with thundercloud)
